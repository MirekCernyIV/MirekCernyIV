## BUT
I absolutely despise the word "but," and I believe I am not alone in my strong dislike for this word. 
This tiny winy innocent word wields a surprising amount of power, allowing anyone to leverage it to their advantage. 
My realtionship with this word is very love-hate type situation. 
I dislike all the possibilities this word can do, but I still find myself using it when I need to.To understand, why this word is such trigger to me. We need to understand, what level of power this word holds.  
Even though it's a tiny word. it can make  others agree with your idea at first and then tear you into shreds.
It's a diplomatic tool, that lets you be all sweet and understanding in the first part of a sentence. Making it seem like you're on the same page as the person you're talking to. 
But then, when you drop the word "but," it's like pulling the trigger on your fictional gun and killing other persons idea. S
Even though I hate this word, and it makes me on the edge whenever I hear it, I can't deny that I use it often. 
I get why it's necessary to make a good argument.
