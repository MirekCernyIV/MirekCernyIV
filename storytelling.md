## Am i on the right path?
I chose this topic, because i think there are moments, when each of us is quiseting our own descions. It could be, that our work sucks, we think that we are not that good, jeoulsy of ohters succes or anything alse. So i meade list of some questions, which can be very harmful can brings us depression very easly. I wanted to know, what they have in common, what is

And suddenly it hits me. All these questions have one thing that ties them together: uncertainty. But why? When did we get used to thinking about life 30 or 40 years into the future? When we got to the point, that we can think, that we an predict future. To answer this question, I need to travel back in history and see if thinking about the future even makes sense.

Let's begin where it all started. The Stone Age is the longest era in which humanity existed. So how did they think about the future? They probably didn't and why would they? Every day had new possibilities for how to die. Poisoning, being stomped by a mammoth, or infection. Everything was random and unpredictable. The main things to worry about were food, a place to sleep, and fire. Without these things, you would certainly die, so why bother about anything else?

In medival age the probability of being aten by Saber-toothed tiger was practicly zero. On the other there were complytly new ways to get killed the very next day. Plagues, disease or wars all these things were out of controll of normal people.SO thinkikng about (again) is basolutly nonses.

Industrial revolution was the era, where it all begind.  Poeple for the first time started slowly gaing and giving the time value. For the first time in history we sorted out food, place to live and fire. We started to have time for thinking about future.

Result of this is that we can be thinking about these silly little questions. To whom we give so much power over us. So if we know this and how really is stupid to think about future, what we should do when we are asking ourself these qusetions.

IDK i just make nice pictures. But i know even the future can be sometimes very scary. We are very lucky, taht we can live in the age were we can ask ourselfs these dump questions.
