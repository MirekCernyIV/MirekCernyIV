#Impruving production of films and TV with Unreal engine 

## Teoritical part
Honestly i chose this topic, because i though it will be easy. I wanted to focus on my animated film, which i needed to produce. However thanks to the fact, that this technology is realitve new and there isnt many guides and people, who would opnely talk about it, i put myself in the tough spot. 

## Practical part 

-At the beginning of writing the script for my film, I knew I had to pick a strategy to have a chance of finishing on time. This project was something completely new for me, so I didnâ€™t really know what kinds of problems I would need to solve. Therefore, K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid) was my approach and thank god.

The topic I chose for my film is the battle between the logical and the creative side, whether  starting to work on the film. The main advantage was that I could draw from my own experiences with procrastination. The environments can be anything I want, and everything is possible, thanks to the abstract nature of the project.

Planning was both very hard and fun. The experience of going through the whole process alone was sometimes overwhelming. I needed to create the script, storyboards, animatics, concept art, dabing, and a bunch of other things. It was hard, but I am glad I went through it and learned so many things.

There needed to be a big difference between our two main characters. The logical side was more angular and boxy to give a feeling of boredom.Additionally, his main color is blue, giving a feeling of calmness and caution. On the other hand, the creative side is more rounded, with orange as his main color, making him seem more lively.

Of course, every big project has countless problems. Some are more severe than others. My main were sickness, disappearing animations, and different frame rates in my project. But I managed to get through it somehow.

Overall, I managed to get through it and finish it on time. Of course, when I look at it now, I see a thousand things I would change. I would write the script differently, improve the animations, or take the film in a completely different direction. But this just shows that I learned something and am not in the same place as I was a year ago.
